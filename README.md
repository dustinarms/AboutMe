# Hello, I'm Dustin
Hi, welcome to the team. I’m so glad you are here at Expedia.  The intention of this document is to give you an idea of how I approach things, think, and work.  It is not intended to replace real human connection, mutual understanding, or relationship we will forge together at work.

It’s going to take a solid quarter to figure this place out. I understand the importance of first impressions, so I know you want to contribute early to the team, but this is a complex place, a complex domain, and full of equally complex problems. Take your time, meet everyone, go to all the meetings, write things down, and ask all the questions – especially about all those baffling acronyms and memes we have in Slack. :)

One of the working relationships we need to define is ours. The following is a user guide to explain me and how I work. It captures what you can expect out of the average week working with me, how I like to work, my north star principles, and some of my idiosyncrasies. My intent is to accelerate our working relationship with the content of this document.

## An Average Week
We’ll have a 1:1 every week (or on the frequency that works best for you) for at least 30 minutes no matter what. If, for whatever reason, I won’t be able to make it I will reschedule with you.  This meeting is for you and while we will discuss updates in it, I fully expect it to be filled with other topics of substance. I will create a private Slack channel for the two us of to capture topics for our 1:1s as well as to provide a handy historic record of what we’ve discussed. When you or I think of a topic, we should just dump it in that channel.  It is helpful for clarity if we pin the items to discuss in or next 1:1, when we have discussed it, we can unpin them.

You can Slack me 24 hours a day. I do not have my notifications turned on so if I am away from my computer or phone I may not respond immediately.  While, I like responding quickly (and do check Slack regularly) I do value my time outside of work.

If I am traveling, I will give you notice of said travel in advance. All our meetings will likely still occur, albeit with time zone considerations.  If I need to cancel them, I will also cancel them in advance.

I work a bit on the weekends. This is my choice. I do not expect that you are going to work on the weekend. I might Slack or email you things, but unless I have made it clear that it is URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday.  If for whatever reason, I absolutely need to get a hold of you, I will call you.

## North Star Principles
<b>People first.</b>  I believe if a person is happy and loves what they are doing they can produce amazing results.  It is my job to optimize for this and help people love what they do here.  My goal is to create ideological diversity on the team as that is key to having an effective team.  All perspectives are relevant, and my goal is to develop productive humans.

<b>Transparency.</b>  I believe in being transparent.  So, if you have a question please ask.  If the answer is something that I cannot share at the time, I will be honest about it.  I do not believe in keeping information away from anyone, but I do feel that topics and concepts that have not been fully thought through can cause more harm than good.

<b>Integrity.</b>  I believe that you cannot build trust without integrity.  Trust is defined as the sum of credibility, reliability, and intimacy divided by a person’s self-motivations. Integrity is key to building that credibility and reliability as well as being genuine in those moments being real (intimacy).

<b>Responsibility.</b>  I am an incredibly responsibility driven person.  I carry a lot of responsibility with me and feel like I am personally responsible for the success of my direct reports and their teams.  Much like integrity responsibility goes into credibility and reliability.

<b>Being Humble.</b>  I believe that being humble promotes learning and growth.  Humility leaves you open to new possibilities and learning from them.  If someone feels like they know it all already, how will they ever improve or grow?  
I believe humility leads to self-awareness.  It’s the act of being honest with yourself about your abilities.  This allows you to recognize areas of improvement in yourself as well as opens you up to feedback.

<b>Improvise.</b>  Improvisation is what makes people successful.  Whether in finish carpentry or software development, improvisation can turn a certain failure into an overwhelming success.  Improvisation is a process to making something.  There are seven skills to improvising.  Play, let yourself fail, listen, say yes, say yes and, play the game, relax and have fun.  This process can be summed up by a TEDx talk from Victoria by Dave Morris (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUO-pWJ0riQ">Dave Morris:  Tedx Victoria)</a>.  I believe there are a lot of parallels to everyday work life in this talk.

<b>Continuous improvement.</b>  Every morning I tell my kids two things… “Win the day” and “Do great things”.  I don’t expect them to do outrageous things during the day, but what I’m trying to instill in them is to be great on a day to day level and you’ll find you can accomplish a lot of things over time.  
I believe in that the compounding benefits of continuously fixing small things creates amazing results.  Quality assurance is everyone’s responsibility and there are improvements to be made everywhere… always. 

<b>Assume positive intent.</b>  I try to start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved. This has worked out well for me over my career.

<b>Overcome adversity.</b>  I once read that if you want to live a life of victory, you must develop the endurance to overcome adversity.  I truly believe this.  We all face adversity in our life and in order to succeed you must push through it.  Adversity is what makes us stronger and allows us to learn about ourselves.  I believe to overcome adversity you need to have an open mind, shed the victim mentality, trust in yourself, be persistent, and build off each small success.
Leadership comes from everywhere.  Being a leader doesn’t mean that you’re a manager.  In fact, I find that, in a lot of cases, the most powerful leadership comes from peers and not managers.  

## Feedback Protocol
I firmly believe that feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team.
At Expedia, there is a formal feedback cycle which occurs once a year, during your annual review.  When we go through this, we’ll draft a proposed set of goals for you for the next review period. These are not product or technology goals; these are professional growth items for you track against. These goals do not need to be published but are intended for you to track as a part of your development.  

We’ll track your development against those goals throughout the year, periodically we’ll create new goals together. At the following review cycle, the process differs thusly: I’ll review you against our prior goals, and we will introduce new development goals (if necessary). Rinse and repeat.

Review periods are not the only time we’ll exchange feedback. This will be a recurring topic in our 1:1s. I will ask you for feedback in 1:1s periodically. I am never going to stop doing this no matter how many times you say you have no feedback for me.  Please know that I believe feedback is a gift and can only make me a better manager.

Disagreement is feedback and the sooner we learn how to efficiently disagree with each other, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better with acquiescence.

While, this feedback protocol is a north start for me, I am a work in progress.  I’m looking to you to keep me accountable to it. :)

## Meeting Protocol
I go to a lot of meetings. I deliberately run with my calendar publicly visible. If you have a question about a meeting on my calendar, ask me. If a meeting is private or confidential, its title and attendees will be hidden from your view. The vast majority of my meetings are neither private nor confidential.

My definition of a meeting includes an agenda and/or intended purpose, the appropriate number of productive attendees, and a responsible party running the meeting to a schedule. If I am attending a meeting, I’d prefer starting on time. If I am running a meeting, I will start that meeting on time. If it’s not clear to me why I am in a meeting, I will ask for clarification on my attendance.

If you send me a presentation deck a reasonable amount of time before a meeting, I will read it before the meeting and will have my questions at the ready. If I haven’t read the deck, I will tell you.

If a meeting completes its intended purpose before its scheduled to end, let’s give the time back to everyone. If it’s clear the intended goal won’t be achieved in the allotted time, let’s stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.

## Nuance and Errata
I am an extrovert, however prolonged exposure to humans is exhausting for me and I require time to recharge. Weird, huh? Small meetings are perfect, medium sized meetings are ok, and larger meetings you may find that I am strangely quiet. Please do not confuse my quiet with lack of engagement.  

I like to think things through before contributing so if my initial reaction to something is silence, please do not read into it. I don't like to repeat anything that's already been said so when I agree you may only hear a plus one or see me nodding. :)

When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.

I prefer an “ask assertive” method versus a “tell assertive” method. If you’d like me to do something, asking is usually a better way than telling me you need it.  I respond incredibly well to ask assertiveness (“Dustin, can you help with X?”). I do not respond as well to being told what to do (“Dustin, I need you to do X.”) I tend to resist doing things that are told to me and at the very best am not excited about getting them done.  This is something I’m working on. :)

## Personal Tidbits
I'm a father to three children, two boys and one girl.  They range in ages from 16 to ~21 months old (this is probably already out of date!).  They are a lot like me and so very different at the same time and I find that fascinating to think about and marvel at.

I have two dogs (for now) and a fish.  Doobie, the chahuahua, is the alpha dog.  He's 12.  Boss, an amercian bully, is what we loving refer to as the land manatee.  We likely will be adding another dog to the mix, but we are holding off until we buy/build a new house.  He's 6.  We also have two goldfish, Barry and Tigger.

I am a Jeep and outdoor enthusiast.  I love love love my Jeep and using it to travel through the outdoors and camp (overland).  The jeep has it's own instagram account (@sasquatch_overland) and I spend a lot of time working on it and adventuring in it.

I play golf and I am blessed to live in an area of the country where I can play golf all year long (alhtough not as nice in the winter as some locations).  I'm not terribly good at it, but I do enjoy the parallels to life that the game has and it's where a lot of my north star principles originated. :)

This document is a living and breathing thing and likely missing large items. I will update it frequently and would appreciate your feedback.

Thanks,
Dustin
